Configs for lab environment are expressed as templates (in TEMPLATES dir) that call data from per-device YAML files.
Generated configs are present in the CONFIGS directory.

If an update to a YAML file is needed, rerun the config generator like so:

./template_gen.py TEMPLATES/$template_file YAML/$yaml_file > CONFIGS > $device.conf

To apply configurations to lab devices (and override existing configuration, first scp the configuration file
to the device. copying the file to /var/tmp works fine for both JunOS and EOS.

To be safe, it's a good idea to double-check the fxp0/Management1 IP addresses and default gateways to make sure they
match the applied configs (if it changes, you'll lock yourself out when you apply the new config).

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

JunOS VMX devices: run the following commands from exec mode:

# Enter configure mode
configure
# Clear existing configuration
load factory-default
# Apply new baseline config
load set /path/to/config
# Optional: view diff between prior baseline and new config
show | compare
# Commit config with timed rollback
commit confirmed 3
# Verify you still have terminal and confirm the config change. If you lock yourself out or otherwise
# fail to confirm, the commit will automatically roll back after 3 minutes.
commit check
# Exit out of config mode
exit

Arista vEOS devices: run from command mode:

# Backup existing config to file 
copy running-config file:/tmp/backup.conf
# Apply uploaded config - "replace" keyword wipes existing config before applying.
configure replace file:/path/to/configfile
# Verify you still have a command line, then save
wr mem

# If you lose your ssh session and get locked out, you'll need to console in via NetworkToCode's
# console UI, and from there restore the backup config via:
configure replace file:/tmp/backup.conf
