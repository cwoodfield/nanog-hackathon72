Configs for lab environment are expressed as templates (in TEMPLATES dir) that call data from per-device YAML files.
Generated configs are present in the CONFIGS directory.

If an update to a config file is needed, cd to the lab directory and run gen_config.sh. This will render configs for all of the lab devices (except for the interface config files on the Ubuntu hosts in the large lab).

To push new configs to all lab routers, run "push_config_replace.py <LAB_DIR_NAME>" from the base_configs 
directory.

MANUAL CONFIG PUSH INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------
To be safe, it's a good idea to double-check the fxp0/Management1 IP addresses and default gateways to make sure they
match the applied configs (if it changes, you'll lock yourself out when you apply the new config).

JunOS VMX devices: run the following commands from exec mode:

# Enter configure mode
configure
# Clear existing configuration
load factory-default
# Apply new baseline config
load set /path/to/config
# Optional: view diff between prior baseline and new config
show | compare
# Commit config with timed rollback
commit confirmed 3
# Verify you still have terminal and confirm the config change. If you lock yourself out or otherwise
# fail to confirm, the commit will automatically roll back after 3 minutes.
commit check
# Exit out of config mode
exit

Arista vEOS devices: run from command mode:

# Backup existing config to file 
copy running-config file:/tmp/backup.conf
# Apply uploaded config - "replace" keyword wipes existing config before applying.
configure replace file:/path/to/configfile
# Verify you still have a command line, then save
wr mem

# If you lose your ssh session and get locked out, you'll need to console in via NetworkToCode's
# console UI, and from there restore the backup config via:
configure replace file:/tmp/backup.conf
